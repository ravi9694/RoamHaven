  "extraInfo": "This clay house was built for a meditation course and It was designed for people to learn being with themselves that is why the function of the house is simple. The house is 35 square meters with essential facilities. It might be considered as a tiny house, yet it’s comfortable for 3 people living together. It has 2 stories:-2 futons on the upper area is like an attic room and 1 bed on the ground floor. The entire house was made of clay (earth), it is not only an eco-friendly building but also good for our health. We believe that our body will absorb good energy from the earth, this means an earthy house brings you close to nature and eliminates bad energy out. It is a very special house for us, too special actually to keep it only for family and friends so we decided to share our paradise to everyone. Hope you would love it like we do.\n",

  "extraInfo": "Houseboats in Kerala, south India, are huge, slow-moving barges used for leisure trips. They are a reworked model of Kettuvallams (in the Malayalam language, Kettu means \"tied with ropes\", andvallam means \"boat\"), which, in earlier times, were used to carry rice and spices from\nKuttanad to the Kochi port. Kerala houseboats were considered a convenient means of transportation. The popularity of Kettuvallams has returned in the function as major tourist attractions. Such a houseboat is about 60 to 120 feet (18 to 36 m) long and about 15 feet (4.6 m) wide at the middle. The hull is made of wooden planks that are held together by ropes of coconut fiber; the usual wood is 'Anjili'. The roof is made of bamboo poles and palm leaves. The exterior of the boat is painted with protective coats of cashew nut oil.",
